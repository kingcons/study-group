## SICP - July 2018

### Objectives

> If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual. - Dan Ingalls

> We should burn all libraries and allow to remain only that which everyone knows by heart. - Hugo Ball

We seek to improve our grasp on the fundamentals of computation by getting away from frameworks and building from small, well-understood primitives.

We challenge ourselves to look beyond new frameworks or technical trends to essential difficulties in the realization of useful software.

We resolve to acknowledge the rich history of computer science and invigorate our day to day work.

Mostly, we want to have fun and hack the good hack. Come join us!

### Schedule

We will be meeting at the TourBuzz offices every Wednesday from 6:00 - 7:30pm.

Readings are expected to be completed prior to the meeting so that limited
in-person time can be spent on discussion and exercises.

In the interest of completing the course in a reasonable time frame (5 months),
we'll target roughly one section a week and about a Chapter a month. We may attempt
to go faster initially as the early material is lighter or adjust the pace if the
group feels it necessary. The schedule is not set in stone!

You are encouraged to attempt the exercises prior to a group meeting! :)

### Resources

#### Textbook

The textbook is of course, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
The group organizer has a physical copy and the book is available through Amazon
but digital copies are freely available.

* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][sicp-web] HTML Version **recommended**
* [SICP epub][sicp-epub]
* [SICP pdf][sicp-pdf]

[sicp-web]: https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/
[sicp-epub]: https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-epub/blob/master/sicp.epub?raw=true
[sicp-pdf]: https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf/raw/master/sicp.pdf

#### Video Lectures

You may wish to accompany the course reading with video lectures. Several sources
exist for this but the course organizer is partial to the original MIT lectures from the
80s. There are also lectures and other materials from UC Berkeley which may prove useful.

* [Original MIT Lectures][mit-lectures] and [download script][script]
* [UC Berkeley lectures][cs-61a]

#### Programming Language

While the course was originally written for MIT Scheme, it has been completed in several
languages including Racket, Common Lisp, Clojure, and Python. The course organizer will
be working through the course in Common Lisp but is also quite fluent in Racket.

For first time lispers, Racket is recommended: [Racket](https://download.racket-lang.org/)

#### Exercises

For the first week or two, we will stick directly to exercises in the textbook.
Group input will be used to decide whether to supplement the existing exercises
with assignments. Potential assignment sources follow:

* [MIT Additional Exercises][mit-exercises]
* [Ars Digita Problem Sets][aduni-exercises]
* [UC Berkeley Homeworks][ucb-exercises] (Python)
* [UC Berkeley Labs][ucb-labs] (Python)
