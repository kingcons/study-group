QUESTIONS:
- Encapsulation as functional AND CS fundamental?

OBSERVATIONS:
- "The contrast between function and procedure is a reflection of the general
  distinction between describing properties of things and describing how to do
  things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the distinction between
  declarative knowledge and imperative knowledge. In mathematics we are
  usually concerned with declarative (what is) descriptions, whereas in
  computer science we are usually concerned with imperative (how to)
  descriptions."
