## Chapter 2 - A Map of the Territory

A language and its implementation are separate things, though for many popular
languages (Ruby and Python among them), there is no official spec. In such cases,
the _behavior_ exhibited by the main implementation is often treated as a de facto
spec. A few popular languages with official standards include: C, C++, Java,
Javascript, and Common Lisp.
