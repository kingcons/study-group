## Challenges

1. There are at least six domain-specific languages used in the little system I 
   cobbled together to write and publish this book. What are they?

* Markdown, HTML, CSS, SASS, Jinja, Makefile.

It feels a bit like double counting to include CSS _and_ SASS to me.

2. Get a “Hello, world!” program written and running in Java. Set up whatever
   Makefiles or objects you need to get it working. If you have a debugger, get 
   comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.

I won't be writing my tree-walking interpreter in Java. I'm using [Reason][reason]
and my "Hello, world" is [here][relox]. (Generated with [spin][spin].)

[reason]: https://reasonml.github.io/
[relox]: https://github.com/kingcons/relox
[spin]: https://github.com/tmattio/spin

3. Do the same thing for C. To get some practice with pointers,
   define a doubly-linked list of heap-allocated strings. Write functions
   to insert, find, and delete items from it. Test them.

TBD.
