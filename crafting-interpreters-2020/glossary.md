### Curry-Howard Isomorphism
A 20th century mathematical discovery of the close relationship between formal logics
(proof systems) and computational calculi, such as the typed lambda calculus. In short,
this shows that every program corresponds to some mathematical proof and any proof can
be modeled by a program.
