## Challenges

1. Write some sample Lox programs and run them (you can use the implementations of
   Lox in my repository). Try to come up with edge case behavior I didn’t specify
   here. Does it do what you expect? Why or why not?

Skipped.

2. This informal introduction leaves a lot unspecified. List several open questions
   you have about the language’s syntax and semantics. What do you think the answers
   should be?

Skipped.

3. Lox is a pretty tiny language. What features do you think it is missing that would
   make it annoying to use for real programs? (Aside from the standard library, of
   course.)

The biggest single feature I can think of that would make lox more practical as a
language is FFI (a Foreign Function Interface). The second thing that comes
to mind is support for asynchronous execution. The final thing for me would be 
a packaging system and package manager for sharing code.

Of course, better error messages and debugging facilities or even syntax highlighting
and editor integration are phenomally important features that are easy to forget
when you're just trying to get a language working to begin with.
