## Crafting Interpreters - Jan 2020

### Objectives

> If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual. - Dan Ingalls

> We should burn all libraries and allow to remain only that which everyone knows by heart. - Hugo Ball

We seek to improve our grasp on the fundamentals of computation by getting away from frameworks and building from small, well-understood primitives.

We challenge ourselves to look beyond new frameworks or technical trends to essential difficulties in the realization of useful software.

We resolve to acknowledge the rich history of computer science and invigorate our day to day work.

Mostly, we want to have fun and hack the good hack. Come join us!

### Schedule

We will be meeting at the Calendly offices every other Wednesday from 5:30 - 7:00pm.

Readings are expected to be completed prior to the meeting so that limited
in-person time can be spent on discussion and exercises.

In the interest of completing the book in a reasonable time frame (6 months),
we'll target 2 chapters per meeting. We can adjust the pace
on the fly as the group deems necessary. The schedule is not set in stone.

You are encouraged to attempt the exercises prior to a group meeting! :)

### Resources

#### Textbook

The textbook is of course, Crafting Interpreters.
The author has graciously provided it online [for free][ci].

[ci]: https://craftinginterpreters.com/

#### Implementation Language

While the book builds their interpreter using Java and their bytecode VM in C,
you are encouraged to use whatever language suits your fancy for your implementation.

I'll likely be using ReasonML for the interpreter and C or Zig for the VM.

If you'd like to contribute written notes or other material for any chapters,
don't hesitate to ask to be added as a collaborator on the study-group
repo!

#### Youtube Lectures, Papers, etc

* To be added as they're discovered...
